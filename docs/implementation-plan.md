- ✅ Documentation structure (organized into focused docs)

**Next Steps**:
1. Set up main project structure
2. Implement unified data models
3. Begin provider service implementations

## Success Metrics

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Provider APIs change unexpectedly
- **Mitigation**: Monitor provider changelogs, version pinning, automated testing

**Risk**: Token refresh failures in production
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive error handling, user-friendly error messages, CLI refresh command

**Risk**: LLM routing accuracy below target
- **Mitigation**: Fallback to domain matching, user override options, continuous prompt tuning

**Risk**: Performance issues with many accounts (10+)
- **Mitigation**: Parallel execution, caching, pagination

### User Experience Risks

**Risk**: OAuth setup too complex for users
- **Mitigation**: Step-by-step guides, video tutorials, helpful error messages

**Risk**: Users confused by multi-account behavior
- **Mitigation**: Clear documentation, account indicators in responses, test commands

**Risk**: Privacy concerns about LLM routing
- **Mitigation**: Default to local models, clear privacy documentation, telemetry redaction

### Community Risks

**Risk**: Low adoption due to niche use case
- **Mitigation**: Target consultant/contractor communities, blog posts, demos

**Risk**: Support burden too high
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation, FAQ, issue templates, community moderators
