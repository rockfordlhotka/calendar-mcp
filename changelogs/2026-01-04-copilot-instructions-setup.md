# Copilot Instructions Setup - January 4, 2026

## Summary

Configured GitHub Copilot Instructions for the calendar-mcp repository following GitHub's best practices for coding agents.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

Added the main entry point file for GitHub Copilot that provides:

- **Quick Context Section**: Direct links to the three key instruction files
  - Project Context & Architecture (context.md)
  - .NET Development Guidelines (dotnet-guidelines.md)
  - Repository Rules (rules.md)

- **Project Overview**: Clear explanation of the MCP server's purpose and the multi-tenant problem it solves

- **Key Architecture Points**: 
  - Provider ≠ Account concept
  - Per-account isolation
  - Smart routing with configurable AI backend
  - Security-first approach

- **Project Structure**: Visual guide to repository organization

- **Technology Stack**: Complete list of technologies used

- **Development Guidelines**: Comprehensive .NET best practices including:
  - Async/await patterns with CancellationToken
  - Dependency injection preferences
  - Logging with ILogger<T> and OpenTelemetry
  - Configuration management with IOptions<T>
  - Error handling and security practices
  - Spectre.Console usage for console apps

- **Development Phases**: Clear roadmap (Phase 1-3)

- **Navigation Guidance**: Step-by-step guide for developers starting work

### 2. Created `/changelogs` Directory

Added a dedicated directory for storing change logs and related documentation:
- Created `changelogs/README.md` explaining the directory's purpose
- Implements the rule from `.github/instructions/rules.md`
- Provides clear guidance on what belongs in this directory

## Why This Matters

GitHub Copilot and other AI assistants can now:
- Quickly understand the project context and architecture
- Follow consistent coding standards and best practices
- Navigate the codebase efficiently
- Make changes that align with project conventions
- Find relevant documentation easily

## Verification

✅ All referenced files and directories exist  
✅ Links are properly formatted and functional  
✅ Content is consistent with existing instruction files  
✅ Code review completed with no issues  
✅ Security check completed with no concerns  

## Existing Structure Leveraged

The repository already had an excellent `.github/instructions/` directory with:
- `README.md` - Overview of instruction files
- `context.md` - Project context and architecture
- `rules.md` - Documentation and change management rules
- `dotnet-guidelines.md` - .NET development best practices

The new `copilot-instructions.md` file serves as the main entry point that references and builds upon these existing resources.
