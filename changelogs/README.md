# Changelogs

This directory contains change logs, documents that summarize changes, and similar assets.

## Purpose

Use this directory to store:
- Change logs and summaries of updates
- Migration guides
- Breaking change documentation
- Release notes drafts

This keeps change documentation organized and prevents it from being scattered throughout the repository.
